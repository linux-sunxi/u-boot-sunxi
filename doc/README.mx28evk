Jumper configuration
---------------------

To boot MX28EVK from an SD card, set the boot mode DIP switches as:

   * Boot Mode Select: 1 0 0 1 (Boot from SD card Slot 0 - U42)
   * JTAG PSWITCH RESET: To the right (reset disabled)
   * Battery Source: Down
   * Wall 5V: Up
   * VDD 5V: To the left (off)
   * Hold Button: Down (off)


Environment Storage
-------------------

There are two targets for mx28evk:

"make mx28evk_config"		- store enviroment variables into MMC

or

"make mx28evk_nand_config"	- store enviroment variables into NAND flash

Choose the target accordingly.

Note: The mx28evk board does not come with a NAND flash populated from the
factory. It comes with an empty slot (U23), which allows the insertion of a
48-pin TSOP flash device.

Follow the instructions from doc/README.mx28_common to generate a bootable SD
card.

Insert the SD card in slot 0, power up the board and U-boot will boot.
