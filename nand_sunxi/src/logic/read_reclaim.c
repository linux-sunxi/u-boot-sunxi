*                       NAND FLASH LOGIC MANAGE LAYER READ-RECLAIM
*
*Description: Repair the logic block whose data has reach the limit of the ability of
*             the HW ECC module correct.
*
*Arguments  : nPage     the page address where need be repaired.
*
*Return     : read-reclaim result;
*               = 0     do read-reclaim successful;
*               = -1    do read-reclaim failed.
*
*Notes      : if read a physical page millions of times, there may be some bit error in
*             the page, and the error bit number will increase along with the read times,
*             so, if the number of the error bit reachs the ECC limit, the data should be
*             read out and write to another physical blcok.
