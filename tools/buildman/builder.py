Theory of Operation

Please see README for user documentation, and you should be familiar with
that before trying to make sense of this.

Buildman works by keeping the machine as busy as possible, building different
commits for different boards on multiple CPUs at once.

The source repo (self.git_dir) contains all the commits to be built. Each
thread works on a single board at a time. It checks out the first commit,
configures it for that board, then builds it. Then it checks out the next
commit and builds it (typically without re-configuring). When it runs out
of commits, it gets another job from the builder and starts again with that
board.

Clearly the builder threads could work either way - they could check out a
commit and then built it for all boards. Using separate directories for each
commit/board pair they could leave their build product around afterwards
also.

The intent behind building a single board for multiple commits, is to make
use of incremental builds. Since each commit is built incrementally from
the previous one, builds are faster. Reconfiguring for a different board
removes all intermediate object files.

Many threads can be working at once, but each has its own working directory.
When a thread finishes a build, it puts the output files into a result
directory.

The base directory used by buildman is normally '../<branch>', i.e.
a directory higher than the source repository and named after the branch
being built.

Within the base directory, we have one subdirectory for each commit. Within
that is one subdirectory for each board. Within that is the build output for
that commit/board combination.

Buildman also create working directories for each thread, in a .bm-work/
subdirectory in the base dir.

As an example, say we are building branch 'us-net' for boards 'sandbox' and
'seaboard', and say that us-net has two commits. We will have directories
like this:

us-net/             base directory
    01_of_02_g4ed4ebc_net--Add-tftp-speed-/
        sandbox/
            u-boot.bin
        seaboard/
            u-boot.bin
    02_of_02_g4ed4ebc_net--Check-tftp-comp/
        sandbox/
            u-boot.bin
        seaboard/
            u-boot.bin
    .bm-work/
        00/         working directory for thread 0 (contains source checkout)
            build/  build output
        01/         working directory for thread 1
            build/  build output
